  abstract = {Transient complexes are crucial for diverse biological processes such as biochemical pathways and signaling cascades in the cell. Here, we give an overview of the transient interactions; the importance of transient interactions as drug targets; and the structural characterization of transient protein--protein complexes based on the geometrical and physicochemical features of the transient complexes' interfaces. To better understand and eventually design transient protein--protein interactions (TPPIs), a molecular perspective of the protein--protein interfaces is necessary. Obtaining high-quality structures of protein--protein interactions could be one way of achieving this goal. After introducing the association kinetics of TPPIs, we elaborate on the experimental techniques detecting TPPIs in combination with the computational methods which classify transient and/or non-obligate complexes. In this review, currently available databases and servers that can be used to identify and predict TPPIs are also compiled.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Identifying protein--protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for deciphering biological pathways. Numerous prediction methods have been developed as cheap alternatives to biological experiments, reporting surprisingly high accuracy estimates. We systematically investigated how much reproducible deep learning models depend on data leakage, sequence similarities and node degree information, and compared them with basic machine learning models. We found that overlaps between training and test sets resulting from random splitting lead to strongly overestimated performances. In this setting, models learn solely from sequence similarities and node degrees. When data leakage is avoided by minimizing sequence similarities between training and test set, performances become random. Moreover, baseline models directly leveraging sequence similarity and network topology show good performances at a fraction of the computational cost. Thus, we advocate that any improvements should be reported relative to baseline methods in the future. Our findings suggest that predicting PPIs remains an unsolved task for proteins showing little sequence similarity to previously studied proteins, highlighting that further experimental research into the `dark' protein interactome and better computational methods are needed.},

However, in certain cases, real-world applications cannot confirm the reported prediction performance. One of the main reasons for this is data leakage, which can be seen as the illicit sharing of information between the training data and the test data, resulting in performance estimates that are far better than the performance observed in the intended application scenario. Data leakage can be difficult to detect in biological datasets due to their complex dependencies. With this in mind, we present seven questions that should be asked to prevent data leakage when constructing machine learning models in biological domains. We illustrate the usefulness of our questions by applying them to nontrivial examples. Our goal is to raise awareness of potential data leakage problems and to promote robust and reproducible machine learning-based research in biology.},

To address this problem, extensive research efforts have been made to extract predefined features from the sequences. Based on these features, statistical algorithms are learned to classify the PPIs. However, such explicit features are usually costly to extract, and typically have limited coverage on the PPI information.                                         Results               We present an end-to-end framework, PIPR (Protein--Protein Interaction Prediction Based on Siamese Residual RCNN), for PPI predictions using only the protein sequences. PIPR incorporates a deep residual recurrent convolutional neural network in the Siamese architecture, which leverages both robust local features and contextualized information, which are significant for capturing the mutual influence of proteins sequences. PIPR relieves the data pre-processing efforts that are required by other systems, and generalizes well to different application scenarios. Experimental evaluations show that PIPR outperforms various state-of-the-art systems on the binary PPI prediction problem. Moreover, it shows a promising performance on more challenging problems of interaction type prediction and binding affinity estimation, where existing approaches fall short.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Models from machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly assist in guiding experimental design and decision making in molecular biology and medicine. Recently, Language Models (LMs) have been adapted from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to encode the implicit language written in protein sequences. Protein LMs show enormous potential in generating descriptive representations (embeddings) for proteins from just their sequences, in a fraction of the time with respect to previous approaches, yet with comparable or improved predictive ability. Researchers have trained a variety of protein LMs that are likely to illuminate different angles of the protein language. By leveraging the               bio\_embeddings               pipeline and modules, simple and reproducible workflows can be laid out to generate protein embeddings and rich visualizations. Embeddings can then be leveraged as input features through machine learning libraries to develop methods predicting particular aspects of protein function and structure. Beyond the workflows included here, embeddings have been leveraged as proxies to traditional homology-based inference and even to align similar protein sequences.

  abstract = {The complex language of eukaryotic gene expression remains incompletely understood. Despite the importance suggested by many proteins variants statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have unknown mechanisms, for example, protein--protein interactions (PPIs). In this study, we address this challenge using a recent machine learning advance-deep neural networks (DNNs). We aim at improving the performance of PPIs prediction and propose a method called DeepPPI (Deep neural networks for Protein--Protein Interactions prediction), which employs deep neural networks to learn effectively the representations of proteins from common protein descriptors. The experimental results indicate that DeepPPI achieves superior performance on the test data set with an Accuracy of 92.50\%, Precision of 94.38\%, Recall of 90.56\%, Specificity of 94.49\%, Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 85.08\% and Area Under the Curve of 97.43\%, respectively. Extensive experiments show that DeepPPI can learn useful features of proteins pairs by a layer-wise abstraction, and thus achieves better prediction performance than existing methods.

  abstract = {Computational biology and bioinformatics provide vast data gold-mines from protein sequences, ideal for Language Models taken from NLP. These LMs reach for new prediction frontiers at low inference costs. Here, we trained two auto-regressive models (Transformer-XL, XLNet) and four auto-encoder models (BERT, Albert, Electra, T5) on data from UniRef and BFD containing up to 393 billion amino acids. The LMs were trained on the Summit supercomputer using 5616 GPUs and TPU Pod up-to 1024 cores. Dimensionality reduction revealed that the raw protein LM-embeddings from unlabeled data captured some biophysical features of protein sequences. We validated the advantage of using the embeddings as exclusive input for several subsequent tasks. The first was a per-residue prediction of protein secondary structure (3-state accuracy Q3=81\%-87\%); the second were per-protein predictions of protein sub-cellular localization (ten-state accuracy: Q10=81\%) and membrane vs. water-soluble (2-state accuracy Q2=91\%). For the per-residue predictions the transfer of the most informative embeddings (ProtT5) for the first time outperformed the state-of-the-art without using evolutionary information thereby bypassing expensive database searches. Taken together, the results implied that protein LMs learned some of the grammar of the language of life.

Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to {$\sim$}24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to {$\sim$}8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions.Availability: ~http://cd-hit.org.Contact: ~liwz@sdsc.eduSupplementary information: ~Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Machine learning may be the most popular computational tool in molecular biology. Providing sustained performance estimates is challenging. The standard cross-validation protocols usually fail in biology. Park and Marcotte found that even refined protocols fail for protein--protein interactions (PPIs).Results: Here, we sketch additional problems for the prediction of PPIs from sequence alone. First, it not only matters whether proteins A or B of a target interaction A--B are similar to proteins of training interactions (positives), but also whether A or B are similar to proteins of non-interactions (negatives). Second, training on multiple interaction partners per protein did not improve performance for new proteins (not used to train). In contrary, a strictly non-redundant training that ignored good data slightly improved the prediction of difficult cases. Third, which prediction method appears to be best crucially depends on the sequence similarity between the test and the training set, how many true interactions should be found and the expected ratio of negatives to positives. The correct assessment of performance is the most complicated task in the development of prediction methods. Our analyses suggest that PPIs square the challenge for this task.Availability and implementation: Datasets used in our analyses are available at https://rostlab.org/owiki/index.php/PPI\_challengesContact: ~rost@in.tum.deSupplementary information: ~Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

For 26\,years, most state-of-the-art approaches combined machine learning and evolutionary information. However, for some applications retrieving related proteins is becoming too time-consuming. Additionally, evolutionary information is less powerful for small families, e.g. for proteins from the                 Dark Proteome                 . Both these problems are addressed by the new methodology introduced here.                                                        Results                                We introduced a novel way to represent protein sequences as continuous vectors (                 embeddings                 ) by using the language model ELMo taken from natural language processing. By modeling protein sequences, ELMo effectively captured the biophysical properties of the language of life from unlabeled big data (UniRef50). We refer to these new embeddings as                 SeqVec                 (                 Seq                 uence-to-                 Vec                 tor) and demonstrate their effectiveness by training simple neural networks for two different tasks. At the per-residue level, secondary structure (Q3\,=\,79\%\,{\textpm}\,1, Q8\,=\,68\%\,{\textpm}\,1) and regions with intrinsic disorder (MCC\,=\,0.59\,{\textpm}\,0.03) were predicted significantly better than through one-hot encoding or through Word2vec-like approaches. At the per-protein level, subcellular localization was predicted in ten classes (Q10\,=\,68\%\,{\textpm}\,1) and membrane-bound were distinguished from water-soluble proteins (Q2\,=\,87\%\,{\textpm}\,1). Although                 SeqVec                 embeddings generated the best predictions from single sequences, no solution improved over the best existing method using evolutionary information. Nevertheless, our approach improved over some popular methods using evolutionary information and for some proteins even did beat the best. Thus, they prove to condense the underlying principles of protein sequences. Overall, the important novelty is speed: where the lightning-fast                 HHblits                 needed on average about two minutes to generate the evolutionary information for a target protein,                 SeqVec                 created embeddings on average in 0.03\,s. As this speed-up is independent of the size of growing sequence databases,                 SeqVec                 provides a highly scalable approach for the analysis of big data in proteomics, i.e. microbiome or metaproteome analysis.                                                        Conclusion               Transfer-learning succeeded to extract information from unlabeled sequence databases relevant for various protein prediction tasks. SeqVec modeled the language of life, namely the principles underlying protein sequences better than any features suggested by textbooks and prediction methods. The exception is evolutionary information, however, that information is not available on the level of a single sequence.},

  abstract = {Proteins are the essential biological macromolecules required to perform nearly all biological processes, and cellular functions. Proteins rarely carry out their tasks in isolation but interact with other proteins (known as protein--protein interaction) present in their surroundings to complete biological activities. The knowledge of protein--protein interactions (PPIs) unravels the cellular behavior and its functionality. The computational methods automate the prediction of PPI and are less expensive than experimental methods in terms of resources and time. So far, most of the works on PPI have mainly focused on sequence information. Here, we use graph convolutional network (GCN) and graph attention network (GAT) to predict the interaction between proteins by utilizing protein's structural information and sequence features. We build the graphs of proteins from their PDB files, which contain 3D coordinates of atoms. The protein graph represents the amino acid network, also known as residue contact network, where each node is a residue. Two nodes are connected if they have a pair of atoms (one from each node)~within the threshold distance. To extract the node/residue features, we use the protein language model. The input to the language model is the protein sequence, and the output is the feature vector for each amino acid of the underlying sequence. We validate the predictive capability of the proposed graph-based approach on two PPI datasets: Human and S. cerevisiae. Obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach as it outperforms the previous leading methods. The source code for training and data to train the model are available at https://github.com/JhaKanchan15/PPI\_GNN.git.},

However, progress in the development of methods to analyze sequential data (e.g. sensor data and event data) has been relatively stagnant. There are six major challenges encountered when conducting sequential-data analysis: high dimensionality, time variance, categorical variables, interpretability, data integration, and privacy. We propose a new multi-rank embedding (MRE) method for sequential data to address these problems. The first rank (row) of the MRE contains the compressed temporal information of the original data, and each row thereafter represents an embedding vector of a specific block (time span) of the original data. Our experiment results indicate that analysis of seq2vec representations can deliver similar performances to those obtained using original raw data for the purposes of clustering household electricity usage patterns, classifying human activities, and forecasting crop yield data at a greatly reduced storage cost. Furthermore, the embedded data does not contain sensitive personal information and can be shared without critical privacy concerns.},

  abstract = {Machine learning based predictions of protein--protein interactions (PPIs) could provide valuable insights into protein functions, disease occurrence, and therapy design on a large scale. The intensive feature engineering in most of these methods makes the prediction task more tedious and trivial. The emerging deep learning technology enabling automatic feature engineering is gaining great success in various fields. However, the over-fitting and generalization of its models are not yet well investigated in most scenarios. Here, we present a deep neural network framework (DNN-PPI) for predicting PPIs using features learned automatically only from protein primary sequences. Within the framework, the sequences of two interacting proteins are sequentially fed into the encoding, embedding, convolution neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network layers. Then, a concatenated vector of the two outputs from the previous layer is wired as the input of the fully connected neural network. Finally, the Adam optimizer is applied to learn the network weights in a back-propagation fashion. The different types of features, including semantic associations between amino acids, position-related sequence segments (motif), and their long- and short-term dependencies, are captured in the embedding, CNN and LSTM layers, respectively. When the model was trained on Pan's human PPI dataset, it achieved a prediction accuracy of 98.78\% at the Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 97.57\%. The prediction accuracies for six external datasets ranged from 92.80\% to 97.89\%, making them superior to those achieved with previous methods. When performed on Escherichia coli, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans datasets, DNN-PPI obtained prediction accuracies of 95.949\%, 98.389\%, and 98.669\%, respectively. The performances in cross-species testing among the four species above coincided in their evolutionary distances. However, when testing Mus Musculus using the models from those species, they all obtained prediction accuracies of over 92.43\%, which is difficult to achieve and worthy of note for further study. These results suggest that DNN-PPI has remarkable generalization and is a promising tool for identifying protein interactions.},

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

PPIs play diverse roles in biology and differ based on the composition, affinity and whether the association is permanent or transient. In vivo, the protomer's localization, concentration and local environment can affect the interaction between protomers and are vital to control the composition and oligomeric state of protein complexes. Since a change in quaternary state is often coupled with biological function or activity, transient PPIs are important biological regulators. Structural characteristics of different types of PPIs are discussed and related to their physiological function, specificity and evolution.},

In infants and young animals, but not in adults, Ca2+-activated chloride channels may cause secretory diarrhea during rotavirus infection. While detailed knowledge exists concerning the contribution of cAMP-activated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channels, analysis of the role of Ca2+-dependent Cl- channels became possible through identification of the anoctamin (TMEM16) family of proteins. We demonstrate expression of several anoctamin paralogues in mouse small and large intestines. Using intestinal-specific mouse knockout models for anoctamin 1 (Ano1) and anoctamin 10 (Ano10) and a conventional knockout model for anoctamin 6 (Ano6), we demonstrate the role of anoctamins for Ca2+-dependent Cl- secretion induced by the muscarinic agonist carbachol (CCH). Ano1 is preferentially expressed in the ileum and large intestine, where it supports Ca2+-activated Cl- secretion. In contrast, Ano10 is essential for Ca2+-dependent Cl- secretion in jejunum, where expression of Ano1 was not detected. Although broadly expressed, Ano6 has no role in intestinal cholinergic Cl- secretion. Ano1 is located in a basolateral compartment/membrane rather than in the apical membrane, where it supports CCH-induced Ca2+ increase, while the essential and possibly only apical Cl- channel is CFTR. These results define a new role of Ano1 for intestinal Ca2+-dependent Cl- secretion and demonstrate for the first time a contribution of Ano10 to intestinal transport.},

Thus, one may obtain biological insights into protein functions, disease prevalence, and therapy development by identifying protein--protein interactions (PPI). However, finding the interacting and non-interacting protein pairs through experimental approaches is labour-intensive and time-consuming, owing to the variety of proteins. Hence, protein--protein interaction and protein--ligand binding problems have drawn attention in the fields of bioinformatics and computer-aided drug discovery. Deep learning methods paved the way for scientists to predict the 3-D structure of proteins from genomes, predict the functions and attributes of a protein, and modify and design new proteins to provide desired functions. This review focuses on recent deep learning methods applied to problems including predicting protein functions, protein--protein interaction and their sites, protein--ligand binding, and protein design.},

Integrating protein structures improves the performance of protein--protein interaction (PPI) prediction. However, the limited quantity of known protein structures restricts the application of structure-based prediction methods. Utilizing the predicted protein structure information is a promising method to improve the performance of sequence-based prediction methods. We propose a novel end-to-end framework, TAGPPI, to predict PPIs using protein sequence alone. TAGPPI extracts multi-dimensional features by employing 1D convolution operation on protein sequences and graph learning method on contact maps constructed from AlphaFold. A contact map contains abundant spatial structure information, which is difficult to obtain from 1D sequence data directly. We further demonstrate that the spatial information learned from contact maps improves the ability of TAGPPI in PPI prediction tasks. We compare the performance of TAGPPI with those of nine state-of-the-art sequence-based methods, and TAGPPI outperforms such methods in all metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to use the predicted protein topology structure graph for sequence-based PPI prediction. More importantly, our proposed architecture could be extended to other prediction tasks related to proteins.},

  abstract = {Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/ MJD), is the most frequent polyglutamine (polyQ) neurodegenerative disorder. It is caused by a pathogenic expansion of the polyQ tract, located at the C-terminal region of the protein encoded by the               ATXN3               gene. This gene codes for a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that belongs to a gene family, that in humans is composed by three more genes (               ATXN3L               ,               JOSD1               , and               JOSD2               ), that define two gene lineages (the               ATXN3               and the Josephins). These proteins have in common the N-terminal catalytic domain (Josephin domain, JD), that in Josephins is the only domain present. In               ATXN3               knock-out mouse and nematode models, the SCA3 neurodegeneration phenotype is not, however, reproduced, suggesting that in the genome of these species there are other genes that are able to compensate for the lack of               ATXN3               . Moreover, in mutant               Drosophila melanogaster               , where the only JD protein is coded by a Josephin-like gene, expression of the expanded human               ATXN3               gene reproduces multiple aspects of the SCA3 phenotype, in contrast with the results of the expression of the wild type human form. In order to explain these findings, phylogenetic, as well as, protein--protein docking inferences are here performed. Here we show multiple losses of JD containing genes across the animal kingdom, suggesting partial functional redundancy of these genes. Accordingly, we predict that the JD is essential for binding with ataxin-3 and proteins of the Josephin lineages, and that               D. melanogaster               mutants are a good model of SCA3 despite the absence of a gene from the               ATXN3               lineage. The molecular recognition regions of the ataxin-3 binding and those predicted for the Josephins are, however, different. We also report different binding regions between the two ataxin-3 forms (wild-type (wt) and expanded (exp)). The interactors that show an increase in the interaction strength with exp ataxin-3, are enriched in extrinsic components of mitochondrial outer membrane and endoplasmatic reticulum membrane. On the other hand, the group of interactors that show a decrease in the interaction strength with exp ataxin-3 is significantly enriched in extrinsic component of cytoplasm.},

The integration of the different types of data allows users to easily compare them, as here shown for Ataxin-1, the polyQ protein involved in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) disease. Using all available datasets and the data here obtained for               Drosophila melanogaster               wt and exp~Ataxin-1 mutants (also available at EvoPPI3), we show that, in humans, the Ataxin-1 network is much larger than previously thought (380 interactors), with at least 909 interactors. The functional profiling of the newly identified interactors is similar to the ones already reported in the main PPI databases. 16 out of 909 interactors are putative novel SCA1 therapeutic targets, and all but one are already being studied in the context of this disease. The 16 proteins are mainly involved in binding and catalytic activity (mainly kinase activity), functional features already thought to be important in the SCA1 disease.},

  abstract = {Much of the complexity within cells arises from functional and regulatory interactions among proteins. The core of these interactions is increasingly known, but novel interactions continue to be discovered, and the information remains scattered across different database resources, experimental modalities and levels of mechanistic detail. The STRING database (https://string-db.org/) systematically collects and integrates protein--protein interactions---both physical interactions as well as functional associations. The data originate from a number of sources: automated text mining of the scientific literature, computational interaction predictions from co-expression, conserved genomic context, databases of interaction experiments and known complexes/pathways from curated sources. All of these interactions are critically assessed, scored, and subsequently automatically transferred to less well-studied organisms using hierarchical orthology information. The data can be accessed via the website, but also programmatically and via bulk downloads. The most recent developments in STRING (version 12.0) are: (i) it is now possible to create, browse and analyze a full interaction network for any novel genome of interest, by submitting its complement of encoded proteins, (ii) the co-expression channel now uses variational auto-encoders to predict interactions, and it covers two new sources, single-cell RNA-seq and experimental proteomics data and (iii) the confidence in each experimentally derived interaction is now estimated based on the detection method used, and communicated to the user in the web-interface. Furthermore, STRING continues to enhance its facilities for functional enrichment analysis, which are now fully available also for user-submitted genomes.},

To test the relevance of this information, we assess the conservation of residues at protein--protein interfaces compared with other residues on the protein surface. Six homodimer families are analyzed: alkaline phosphatase, enolase, glutathione S-transferase, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor, and triose phosphate isomerase. For each family, random simulation is used to calculate the probability (P value) that the level of conservation observed at the interface occurred by chance. The results show that interface conservation is higher than expected by chance and usually statistically significant at the 5\% level or better. The effect on the P values of using different definitions of the interface and of excluding active site residues is discussed. Proteins 2001;42:108--124. {\copyright} 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},
